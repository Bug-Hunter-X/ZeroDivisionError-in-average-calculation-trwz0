# ZeroDivisionError in Average Calculation
This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError` that can occur when calculating the average of an empty list.  The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code.  The solution, avoiding the error, is provided in `bugSolution.py`.

The error is handled gracefully by checking for an empty list before performing the division.
